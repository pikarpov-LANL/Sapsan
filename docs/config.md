| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `name` | name of the run, as it will show up in the scores.dat and stats.dat | 'test' |
| `parameters` | parameters (e.g. features) to train on | None |
| `target` | target parameter to train against and to predict | None |
| `path` | path to the data | '/raid1/JHTDB' |
| `dataset` | which data set to use; options are 'iso' for HD turbulence, and 'mhd' for MHD turbulence | 'iso' |
| `savepath` | where to save the data | 'Figures' |
| `alpha` | will use the default KRR alpha | None |
| `gamma` |  will use the default KRR gamma | None |
| `dim` |  dimension of the training set | 128 |
| `max_dim` |  initial dimension of the data file, from which training and testing sets will be extracted | 512 |
| `step` | spatial separation between each data point used for training; default is to choose the step to cover the whole domain with equidistent point separation | None |
| `ttrain` | training timestep | [0] |
| `dt` |  numeral value for dt to calculate the actual time of each timestep | 1 |
| `fm` | number of modes to filter down to | 15 |
| `filtname` |  filter to use; available options also include 'boxfilt' | 'spectral' |
| `axis` |  dimensionality; either 2 or 3 | 2 |
| `from3D` |  extracts 2D slice from 3D data; only relevant if axis=2 | False |
| `outliers` |  only include outliers when adding consecutive steps, thus the data from additional timesteps won't be sampled in the same way as the 1st timestep | False |
| `datatype` | what loader to choose; options also include .txt, .dat | 'h5' |
| `parLabel` | label of the training dataset in the hdf5 container; default is to use [-1] dataset | None | 
| `targetLabel` | label of the target dataset in the hdf5 container; default is to use [-1] dataset | None | 
| `n_epochs` | the number of epochs to iterate over | 100 |
| `batch_size` | the number of training batches | 12 |
| `cube_size` | the size of the cubes to split the data into | 8 |
| `method` | method to use for training; either 'cnn' or 'krr' | 'krr' |
| `experiment_name` | name of the experiment for mlflow tracking | 'demo' |
