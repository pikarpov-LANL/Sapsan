Sapsan is a pipeline for Machine Learning (ML) based turbulence modeling. While turbulence is important in a wide range of mediums, the pipeline primarily focuses on astrophysical applications. With Sapsan, one can create their own custom models or use either conventional or physics-informed ML approaches for turbulence modeling included with the pipeline ([estimators](https://github.com/pikarpov-LANL/Sapsan/wiki/Estimators)). Sapsan is designed to take out all the hard work from data preparation and analysis, leaving you focused on ML model design, layer by layer.

Feel free to check out a website version at [sapsan.app](http://sapsan.app). The interface is identical to the GUI of the local version of Sapsan, except lacking the ability to edit the model code on the fly.

## [Sapsan's Wiki](https://github.com/pikarpov-LANL/Sapsan/wiki)

Please refer to Sapsan's Github Wiki to learn more about the framework's details and capabilities.

## Quick Start

### 1. Install PyTorch (prerequisite)
Sapsan can be run on both CPU and GPU. Please follow the instructions on [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) to install the latest version (torch>=1.7.1 & CUDA>=11.0).

### 2. Install via pip (recommended)
```
pip install sapsan
```

#### OR Clone from git
```
git clone https://github.com/pikarpov-LANL/Sapsan.git
cd Sapsan/
python setup.py install
```

Note: see [Installation Page](https://github.com/pikarpov-LANL/Sapsan/wiki/Installation/) on the Wiki for complete instructions with Graphviz and Docker installation.

### 3. Test Installation

To make sure everything is alright, run a test of your setup:
```
sapsan test
```

### 4. Run Examples

To get started and familiarize yourself with the interface, feel free to run the included examples ([CNN](https://github.com/pikarpov-LANL/Sapsan/wiki/Estimators#convolution-neural-network-cnn) or [PICAE](https://github.com/pikarpov-LANL/Sapsan/wiki/Estimators#physics-informed-convolutional-autoencoder-picae) on 3D data, and [KRR](https://github.com/pikarpov-LANL/Sapsan/wiki/Estimators#kernel-ridge-regression-krr) on 2D data). To copy the examples, type:
```
sapsan get_examples
```
This will create a folder `./sapsan_examples` with appropriate example jupyter notebooks.

### 5. Create Custom Projects!
To start a custom project, designing your own custom estimator, i.e., network, go ahead and run:
```
sapsan create {name}
```
where `{name}` should be replaced with your custom project name. As a result, a pre-filled template for the estimator, a jupyter notebook to run everything from, and Docker will be initialized.
