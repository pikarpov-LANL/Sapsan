### POC example

TODO

```python
from sapsan.general.experiment import MlflowExperiment
from sapsan.general.data.dataset import JHTDBDataset
from sapsan.general.estimator.krr import KrrEstimatorConfiguration, KrrEstimator
from sapsan.utils.plot import PlotUtils

# create dataset
dataset = JHTDBDataset('somepath')
# create model
estimator = KrrEstimator(KrrEstimatorConfiguration(0.001, 1.789))
#create experiment
experiment = MlflowExperiment(estimator=estimator, dataset=dataset, callbacks=[
    PlotUtils.plot_histograms,
    PlotUtils.plot_slices
])
# run experiment
experiment.run()
# get report on experiment run
experiment.get_report()
```
