        Sapsan is a pipeline for Machine Learning (ML) based turbulence modeling. While turbulence 
        is important in a wide range of mediums, the pipeline primarily focuses on astrophysical application. 
        With Sapsan, one can create their own custom models or use either conventional or physics-informed 
        ML approaches for turbulence modeling included with the pipeline ([estimators](https://github.com/pikarpov-LANL/Sapsan/wiki/Estimators)).
        For example, Sapsan features ML models in its set of tools to accurately capture the turbulent nature applicable to Core-Collapse Supernovae.
        
        > ## **Purpose**
        
        > Sapsan takes out all the hard work from data preparation and analysis in turbulence 
        > and astrophysical applications, leaving you focused on ML model design, layer by layer.
